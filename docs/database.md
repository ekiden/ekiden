# Database

The Ekiden database serves as a persistent state store for contracts.

## Interfaces

Only the trusted API exposed to contracts should be considered relatively stable. **How state is serialized and stored outside the contract and the EDL interface is currently an unstable implementation detail which will change in future versions.**

### Trusted API exposed to contracts

```rust
/// Database interface exposed to contracts.
pub trait Database {
    /// Returns true if the database contains a value for the specified key.
    fn contains_key(&self, key: &[u8]) -> bool;

    /// Fetch entry with given key.
    fn get(&self, key: &[u8]) -> Option<Vec<u8>>;

    /// Update entry with given key.
    ///
    /// If the database did not have this key present, [`None`] is returned.
    ///
    /// If the database did have this key present, the value is updated, and the old value is
    /// returned.
    fn insert(&mut self, key: &[u8], value: &[u8]) -> Option<Vec<u8>>;

    /// Remove entry with given key, returning the value at the key if the key was previously
    /// in the database.
    fn remove(&mut self, key: &[u8]) -> Option<Vec<u8>>;
}
```
